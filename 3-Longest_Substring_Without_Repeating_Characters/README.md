Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```

Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3

             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

遍历字符串用字典保存每个字符对应的下标,  
每次循环跟新左右两个指针
